# Introduction 
T-cells themselves have receptors protein (TCR) that recognize antigens. These exhibit diversity within subjects. TCR alpha-chain and beta-chain each have complementarity determining regions (CDRs). These regions are highly variable even within the subjects.

# Technologies
It follows that there is lots of variability in the proteins mirror diversity in the underlying DNA sequences. Previous technoologies use flow cytometry and spectratype data, and a divergence metric that quantifies the deviation from normal of T-cell receptor repertoire (Stanca M CiupeEmail author, Blythe H Devlin, Mary Louise Markert and Thomas B Kepler 2013). 

Immuno-Seq 


 permit simultaneous sequencing from genomic DNA of the rearranged TCR􏰀 CDR3 regions carried in millions of T cells.


We adapted the Illumina GA system to permit simultaneous sequencing from genomic DNA of the rearranged TCR􏰀 CDR3 regions carried in millions of T cells. This approach enables direct sequencing of a significant fraction of the uniquely rearranged TCR􏰀 CDR3 regions in populations of 􏰁􏰀 T cells whose diversity far exceeds the capabilities of conventional capillary-based DNA sequencing instruments, and also permits estimation of the relative frequency of each CDR3 sequence in the population.



# Statistics



# Since not all the variations are observed in the target population in any given sample, statistical techniques are needed to infer the diversity itself within a given patient, and then variability across patients.Application
